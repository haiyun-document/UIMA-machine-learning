This file defines the mappings from user name to comma seperated list
of directories/files that the user is allowed to access. One mapping
per user. Wildcard characters, such as "*" and "?", are not recognized. 
For example, to match "/output" directory, one can use "/output" or 
"/output/", but not "/output/*". Note that any leading or trailing
whitespaces are stripped/ignored for the name field.
